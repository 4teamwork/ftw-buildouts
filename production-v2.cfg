# New style of deployments:
# - increased security through support for multiple users
# - deployments are now located at /apps/0x-plone-y
# - the groups "deploy" and "zope" make sure every user has the right access
#   to the files
# - files are owned by the deploying user and the service user (zope) does not
#   have write access to the source code and other files
# - files which are written by the service user (zope), such as the database,
#   are owned by the zope group.
#
# Usage:
# This config file must be extended after extending the production.cfg.
# It is not a replacement for the production.cfg but an extension.
